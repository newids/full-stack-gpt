The building is in disrepair, with shabby living conditions and a general sense of neglect. It has glass doors, a hallway that smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats, and a poster of an enormous face with the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.\" Winston\\'s small and cramped apartment is seven flights up, with a faulty lift due to power cuts during daylight hours. The building also features a telescreen, a surveillance device that constantly broadcasts information. From Victory Mansions, one can see all four Ministries of Oceania, although the building is dwarfed by their grandeur. Winston\\'s apartment has an unusual layout with the telescreen placed on the longer wall opposite the window, and an alcove where he can sit out of its sight. The presence of a unique old book in the room inspires Winston to take a particular action, despite Party members not being allowed to visit ordinary shops.')"
